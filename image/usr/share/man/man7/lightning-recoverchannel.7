SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fBrecoverchannel\fR \fIscb\fR
.SH
DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBrecoverchannel\fR RPC command tries to force the peer (with whom you
already had a channel) to close the channel and sweeps on-chain fund. This
method is not spontaneous and depends on the peer, so use it in case of
severe data loss.
.PP
The \fIscb\fR parameter is an array containing minimum required info to
reconnect and sweep funds. You can get the scb for already stored channels
by using the RPC command 'staticbackup'
.SH
RETURN VALUE
.LP
On success, an object is returned, containing:
- \fBstubs\fR (array of hexs):
- Each item is the channel ID of the channel successfully inserted
